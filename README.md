# Arduino Clapper-Controlled RGB Lighting

## Overview
A sound-responsive lighting system that detects claps and changes LED colors. Initially built as a single light switch, later improved to simulate RGB lighting with three LEDs.

## Features
- Clap detection via mic module
- Lighting control with multiple clap patterns
- Debugged timing and sensitivity for reliable input

## Technologies Used
- Arduino Mega 2560
- Microphone module
- RGB LED (simulated using 3 separate LEDs, RGB Led was DOA)

## Lessons Learned
- Debugged sensor noise issues and fine-tuned clap detection.
- Iterated from a buggy prototype to a functional RGB simulation.

## Future Improvements
- Replace simulated LEDs with a proper RGB LED module.
- Add customizable clap patterns for different lighting modes.
- Add adjustable sensitivity
